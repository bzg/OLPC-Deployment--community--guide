<h1 class="title">Planning Phase</h1>

<p>The planning phase initiates with the idea of starting a project with One
Laptop Per Child and concludes once an order is placed with the
manufacturer.  OLPC provides assistance to sponsors in making the decisions
necessary during this phase, and in defining actions required in accordance
with the objectives of the program.  During the planning phase, sponsors
can get a better understanding of the elements involved in various stages
of deployment, including human, technical, and financial aspects.  The
elements included in the planning phase are: consideration of possible
financing approaches, a feasibility study, and a purchasing agreement
followed by an order for laptops.

<h2 id="sec-1">Financing Approaches </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">



<p>
In considering a deployment with OLPC, project sponsors typically take one
of following three approaches:
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Geographic Focus </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">



<p>
With the geographic approach, a project sponsor selects a particular region
that is of interest to them.  Such region can be a country, state, city or
community.  A multi-city approach is not recommended as it leads to less
efficient use of infrastructure and administration, reducing the number of
children reached.  With the region selected, a project sponsor should be
able to determine the number of students, teachers and schools in that
region.  The number of schools with electricity and Internet connectivity
should also be determined.  With these five pieces of information, a
sponsor can use the feasibility model in the appendix to determine the
annual budget for the project and decide whether a phased approach is
necessary given possible budget constraints.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">Budget Constraints </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">



<p>
Many project sponsors come to OLPC with a country selected and a fixed
budget to support a project.  Within 2-4 hours working with OLPC, a sponsor
can determine the number of students that can be benefited by the project.
For this process to work efficiently, the following information is
required:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Average number of students per school
</li>
<li>Average number of teachers per school
</li>
<li>% of schools with electrification
</li>
<li>% of schools with Internet connectivity
</li>
</ul>


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Political or social objectives </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">



<p>
Some sponsors view an OLPC project as a means of achieving political or
social change.  For example, the government of Uruguay undertook their
project CEIBAL as a way of fostering social inclusion.  This approach does
not present a challenge for OLPC; in fact, it often leads to the
development of a project strategy far quicker than either of the other two
approaches.  With the use of the feasibility model and the four pieces of
information outlined in the Fixed Budget approach, any politically- or
socially- oriented project can be translated into a budget and the number
of laptops to be deployed.

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Key Assumptions </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
It is important for a sponsor to understand certain key assumptions about
the costs involved in carrying out a project:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended that full-time staff with no other responsibilities
  manage a deployment. Ideally, a new company/foundation or government
  agency is formed to undertake the responsibility.  While such an approach
  may add to the cost, OLPC believes that the cost is more than offset by
  the improved effectiveness of management.  This approach also leads to a
  healthy separation of day-to-day management from politics in
  government-sponsored projects.

</li>
<li>Pedagogical staff is the key to a successful deployment, both initially
  and thereafter.  Consequently, the staffing budget provides for each
  school to be visited at least once a month after initial training to
  reinforce training and improve teacher skills.  Significant expenses are
  also incurred through network and connectivity management at the school
  level and through maintenance of the portals that serve students,
  parents, teachers and the community.

</li>
<li>It is recommended that a project has a call center to provide help desk
  and technical support to students, teachers and parents.  These centers
  also manage the repair process for inoperable units.  A budget for spare
  parts based on historical statistics is included in the model.  Necessity
  of repairs may vary depending on the student usage of the laptops.

</li>
<li>The cost of electricity and connectivity is highly dependent on the
  country of the deployment and service availability.  The model is
  designed to provide for solutions in any environment from no available
  services for electricity and connectivity to a full complement of
  services similar to the U.S.  and any alternative in between.  A detailed
  survey by school conducted by trained professionals improves the accuracy
  of the model greatly.  The most likely factor to be overlooked is the
  increase in electricity consumption at schools after the computers are
  delivered to the children.

</li>
<li>A significant additional cost for the computers may be import duties and
  taxes.  OLPC does not offer legal and tax advice and does not participate
  in schemes aimed at reducing or avoiding taxes and duties.  Determination
  of applicable expenses for such items is the responsibility of the
  sponsor.  OLPC does provide estimated costs for freight and insurance and
  typically quotes the laptop price as CIF.  Given that OLPC has much
  greater experience arranging ocean freight from China (through DHL) than
  most project sponsors, It is recommended that the sponsor allow OLPC to
  do it.  OLPC does not markup freight and insurance.
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Financial Assumptions </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">



<p>
The following table offers a breakdown of the costs associated with
executing a project.  The first group of assumptions refers to
non-recurring costs such as hardware, shipping, and electrical setup (if
necessary).  The second group includes recurring costs such as monthly
operating costs and salaries for employees.

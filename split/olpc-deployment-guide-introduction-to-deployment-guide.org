This document provides guidelines for program directors (government
officials, foundations, private funders, etc.)  conducting One Laptop per
Child deployments on a large scale to schools, cities, regions, or country
wide.

This guide outlines key considerations to be taken into account throughout
the different stages of a deployment.  It captures the knowledge and
expertise gained from deploying over 2 million laptops across more than 30
countries around the world.  Therefore, this document can be adapted for
each new deployment according to each countryâ€™s unique cultural, economical
and socio -- political context and in accordance with its particular
strengths and capabilities.

* Deployment Phases Overview

A deployment can be divided in three main phases: Planning Phase,
Deployment Phase, and Post- Deployment Phase.  This document is meant to
guide project managers through the roadmap towards a successful deployment,
by describing essential steps, and decisions to consider, and by suggesting
an action timeline.
